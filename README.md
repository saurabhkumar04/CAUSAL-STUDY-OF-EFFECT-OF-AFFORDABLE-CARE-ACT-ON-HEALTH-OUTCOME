    abstract: >
        Affordable care act (ACA) has been the topic of many debates. Studies have been conducted in the past to understand
        its impact on insurance enrollment and labor markets. Easier access to health insurance via ACA might improve public's
        ability to get health checkups and improve chronic disease diagnosis rate. The aim is to understand the impact of ACA
        enforcement on chronic disease detection and health outcomes. ACA was adopted in 32 states by end of 2013 while 19
        states decided to not adopt ACA. This creates an opportunity to understand the effect of ACA via a difference in
        difference methodology. Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data is used to understand the effect of ACA.
        DID is combined along with matching on covariates to provide a robust estimate of ACA's impact.

    key question:
        What is the effect of ACA expansion on the detection of chronic health diseases like diabetes?
